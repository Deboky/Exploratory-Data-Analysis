# Exploratory Data Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on visualizing various aspects of a dataset provided as part of this coursework. The dataset encapsulates different characteristics which include correlations, seasonal behavior, and outliers. This README outlines the methodology and insights from the visual exploration aimed at understanding the dynamics of customer visits across stores with varying footfall.

## Visualization Breakdown

### Dataset Segmentation
The dataset is categorized into four segments based on the volume of customer traffic:
- **High**
- **Medium**
- **Low**
- **Very Low**

These categories help to focus our analysis on stores with higher and medium customer traffic as per the company's interest.

### Visualization Techniques and Insights

1. **Line Plot**
   - Provides a segmentation of stores based on the number of customer visits.
   - This initial visualization sets the stage for a detailed analysis by highlighting the stores under consideration.

2. **Trendlines**
   - These plots are crucial for understanding the dynamics in customer visits over the year, particularly for stores with a medium volume of traffic.

3. **Box Plot**
   - Offers insights into distribution and identifies outliers specifically for stores with a high number of customers, facilitating targeted strategic decisions.

4. **Radar Plot**
   - An overlaid radar plot that summarizes data for stores with high customer footfall, providing a comparative perspective on key metrics.

5. **Autocorrelation**
   - Evaluates seasonal patterns in customer visits, aiding in the anticipation of peak periods.

6. **Interactive Visualizations**
   - Includes an interactive histogram and bubble plot that allow deeper investigation into the characteristics of stores with high and medium customer traffic.

### Key Observations

- **Store ZMS**
  - Exhibits a negative linear trend, with customer numbers decreasing throughout the year, suggesting a potential closure consideration.

- **Stores with Positive Trends**
  - Stores such as "NMO", "AEI", "NGB", "YYO", "ZSD", "MAJ" show positive trendlines. Initially, these stores had fewer customers, but experienced a gradual increase, likely influenced by effective marketing, the introduction of popular products, and strategic sales events.

## Conclusion

The exploratory data analysis provided here reveals critical insights into customer behavior and store performance, serving as a foundation for strategic decision-making. Further analysis could extend these observations with predictive modeling to forecast future trends.
