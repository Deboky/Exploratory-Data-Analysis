# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
Visualisation of Dataset using various plots
Various aspects of the data could be observed throughout the data exploration in this coursework. The 
dataset that has been provided contains different characteristics that have been acknowledged. These are 
correlations, seasonal behavior, outliers. As the company is interested in the stores having a higher and 
medium number of customers, the visualisations provided contain the characteristics of the stores with a 
higher and medium number of customers. Thus, dividing the dataset into high, medium, low, and very low 
helped to understand the stores better. Different plots have different advantages over the other, which 
imparts several meanings associated with the dataset. The first visualisation contains a line plot that conveys
the stores' segmentation based on the number of customer visits. The second visualisation deals with the 
trendlines for a medium number of customers, which gives the idea about the increase or decrease of 
customer visits throughout the year. Next, the box plot's addition gives a clear picture about distribution 
and outliers for the stores with a higher number of customers. Then, overlaid Radar plot has been added 
that gives the idea about the summary data for stores with a higher number of customers. To understand the 
correlation among the summary data, the radar plot has been included. To check for seasonal behavior of 
the stores, autocorrelation has been introduced. Lastly, the two interactive plots containing histogram and 
bubble plot were added to investigate the stores with a high and medium number of customers.
While exploring the dataset, I have found an exciting aspect of stores with a very low number of customers. 
Store “ZMS” shows negative linearity, which means the number of customers in that store decreased 
throughout the year linearly. There is thus a possibility of closing that store. On the other hand, stores 
"NMO","AEI","NGB","YYO","ZSD","MAJ" shows positive trendlines. At the starting of the year, there 
was very a smaller number of customers but gradually the number of customers increased. This could be 
possible because of various reasons such as store marketing, the introduction of popular products, sales, 
etc
